 why dont you open with a joke?  wait a minute, hold the phone! youre not talking aboutchuckles university?!  yes, you got something from the screen actors guild.  okay, its not a check. theyre saying your health insuranceexpired because, you didnt work enough last year.  all right.  im sorry man, theres never a good time to  stopcatching on fire.  hey!  thats great, but shouldnt you be on the toilet right now?

oh right,coach ruben.  do you know what pheebs? when youre done over there, we kinda have asituation over here too.   see thats where i think that youre wrong. weve beenplaying these babies man for man; we should really be playing a zone defense.  i just think that things would go a lot smoother if we each have ourown zone. phoebe, you can be in charge of wiping. and yknow mon, you can be incharge of diapering and i can be in charge of looking how cute they are when they puttheir hands around   okay, im a rookie. i should not be in the end zone.  shocking! since you still have the keys.  what equity investments?  you dont even have a car!  and?  there you are.   check it out! check it out! when the babies wake up, theycan meet krog!   he can do more than that! he can destroy the universe!  theyre not gonna swallow anything, you guys are being way overprotective. when i was a kid, my mom used to just throw me into a pile of broken glass!  glass, sand, whatever.   well, i was trying to prove that i was right. yknow? and itturns out i was wrong. and now its lodged in my throat.    but you found the keys to his clothes?  that is true.  ahh, i think it just moved. its really poking me.   hey!  was the setting of phoebes triumph.  is not as important as the fact that phoebe took care of the babiesall by herself.   phoebe, would you take a look at this mess!!!!   okay!  listen, im gonna be moving out so youwill be in charge of paying the rent.  its not charity, joe  okay uh, heres the electric bill.   uh, yeah.  so, well do the rest of the bills later then?  no, i hope not! i tried to offer him some money, but he wouldnttake it.  i figure that $1,500 would cover him for a few months, yknow?but i have to trick him into taking it so i wont hurt his pride.  well that would help the pride thing.  hey! wow! you look great! wanna move in with me tomorrow?  okay!  so, what do you girls have planned for tonight?  well, instead of just hanging out, we figure wed do nothing.  oh nope, i-i have plans with joey.  oh, i wish id know you were going to do that, i ordered chinese.  say, joe, i had a strange idea of what we could do for our last night.what do you say we play a little uh, foosball for money?

 youre kidding right?  you win.  it doesnt matter because nothing beats a three and a six. thatmy friend is d-cup. okay, now much have you won so far?  not 700 exactly?  double it!   well you see in cups, once you get $700, you have to double it.  hey, i didnt make up the rules. now, after you receive thedoubling bonus, you get uh, one card. now that one card could be worth $100 bringing yourtotal to 1,500.  dont get to excited because thats notgonna happen unless you getno way!   whats wrong?  wh-how did you lose at cups?!  oh man!!  all right, lets play one more hand! one more!  i cant take the big white dog! you love it!  when did i try to give you money?  im just trying to help you out! okay?

we are still getting all your bills and stuff.  a pharmacist.   you took off your pants and climbed under the sheets!  you made pottery?  ahh, just like the apothecary tables of yore  so then the farmer says, \"thats not a cow andyoure not milking it.\"    look at us, were a couple of couples!  yeah all right.  okay, good night guys.  oh thats too bad.  thats funny, i saw no phlegm.  then why-why is she going to a play?!  well, why does she not want to hang out with us?!  so she was just pretending to have a good time last night? she waslying to our faces?!  and i am not blah, i am a hoot!  no, you shno you said you made that up!!  eh, theyre both good. i generally just go with, monicasdrunk again.    okay, one more time.  perfect decibel.  hey.  oh nothing, were just talking. yknow, blah-blah-blah.  thats totally understandable.  oh yeah!  and im blah? listen, the only thing more boring than watchingmodern dance is having to listen to you talk about it,  \"oh chandler,i just lost myself in the moment.\"   yknow i think you can take her.  yeah, im sorry man.  you wanna go watch?  you okay?  that is funny. it was also funny when i made it up.  i made that joke up.  yes, i did. i told it to dan at work, and he said it was the funniestjoke hed ever heard.  seriously?  yeah, i guess.   hey, joey, playboyprinted my joke.  its my joke.  dude, you have got to turn on behind the music. the band heartis having a really tough time, and i think they may break up.  if you need money, will you please-please just let me loan you somemoney?  whoa ho.   all right, you want to see if the joke stealerwill let us watch the show at his place?  so, you heard it, you repeated it, so that must mean you wrote it.  and monkeys cant write out prescriptions.   you are not allowed to laugh at my joke.  so, you stole my joke, and you stole my money.  well, she is going to know that you stole the joke.  yeah!  okay .  you know who else picked rachel? ross, and you know what else rossdid? he stole my joke. you know what? im going to get a joke journal. yknow?and document the date and time of every single one of my jokes.  yeah!  picking rachel.  maybe its the sound of ross climbing into my brain and stealingmy thoughts.  so is your apron. youre wearing it like a cape.  lets have monica decide.  yeah!  mon, get out here!  okay, okay. you have to help us decide whose joke this is.  because youre the only one that can be fair.   dont try to sway her.   imyour only chance to have a baby. okay, lets go.  okay, i thought of the joke two months ago at lunch with steve.  can i finish my story?!  so steve said he had to go to the doctor. and stevesdoctors name is doctor muppy. so i said, doctor monkey? and that is howthe whole doctor monkey thing came up.   im not arguing with that.  hi, oh hi.   monica is a self-sufficient,together lady.  being with her has been like being on a vacation. and what may beperceived as high maintenance is merely attention to detail andgenerosity of spirit.   im out of words. should i just say the whole thingagain?   youre a littlehigh maintenance.  im sorry. youre not easy-going, but yourepassionate, and thats good. and when you get upset about the little things, i thinkthat im pretty good about making you feel better about that. and thats goodtoo. so, they can say that youre high maintenance, but its okay, because ilike  maintaining you.   im off the list.    hey, buddy boy, howd the audition go?

 uhh, youve had a lot of sex right?  well, its just the reason that im asking is because i kindof eh, uh, i was unable toi mean i really wanted too, but i couldnt.there huhhmm, there-there was an incident.  its happened to you?  well, whatd you do?   i dont think thats what they were talking aboutjoe!!  what?!  yes, you can pass for 19.  yes!  now monica, i know youre upset, but dont forget. there isgoing to be a wedding, you are going to throw the bouquet, and then theresgoing to be a honeymoon, maybe in paris.  we will take a moonlit walk on the rue de la .  then we will sprinkle rose pedals on the bed and make love. not justbecause its romantic, but because i can!  okay, dont say anything, you might scare it away.  its paris, who knows were here!  pheebs, were not giving you a deposit for our wedding!  oh, give her the deposit! give her the ring! i dont care!  what a great apology!  and you accept! okay, bye-bye!   ahh, third base.  well, somebody should.   how is that ever going to happen?!   i dont care, she slept with me.  thanks.   hey! heres a dollar, consider ita deposit. please sing at our wedding.  whats the matter honey?   already?!  oh, i got some thoughts on that.  what in gods name is that?!  well, you couldnt get them anyway. ian doesnt plan anymoreand derrick  and derrick is a name ishouldnt know.  why are you napping over here instead of over at your place?  centerpieces!  definitely roses.  well, i justthink theyre a little more weddingy. but lilies are the clear choice.  oh yeah, i should probably call them.  oh, i dont think i ever heard that story.  what a sweet story.  clearly i did not start drinking enough at the start of the meal.  i dont know, my mother spent most of her money on her fourthwedding. shes saving the rest for her divorce. and any extra cash my father has hesaves for his yearly trips to  dollywood.  look, it really is gonna be okay. the important thing is that we loveeach other and that were gonna get married.  well, i have some.  well, close to    well, come on, ive been saving this money for six years and ikinda had some of it earmarked for the future, not just for a party.  look, i understand, but i have to put my foot down. okay? the answeris no.  yes, i am!  ehh.  look, i thought about it too, and im sorry. i think we shouldspend all of the money on the wedding.  yeah, im putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i toldyou that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makesyou happy then, then thats what were gonna do.  eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids,yknow? well pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  yeah.  uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.  well, stuff like whered we live, yknow? like a small placeoutside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. yknow,we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time itran through the little kitty door. of course, wed have an apartment over the garagewhere joey could grow old.  sure you do.  you sure?  i love you so much.  oh yeah, totally!  hey, you guys!  i got glasses!  no i didnt!  no!   you didnt think i used towear glasses, right?  thats okay pheebs, were not having a party or anything, soyou dont have to get us  what we want honey.  dying people say the craziest things.  our kids are gonna be fat arent they.  well, its good that you finally have a place to do that.  do you know what i was thinkin?  nothing, i just like to go like this.   uh why, do you have a lecture?  then free as a bird. whats up?  well, did-did you correct him?  oh no problem, maybe ill play with my left hand.  does anybody know me?!  dont worry about it pheebs.  an old cookie?  we cant accept this.  cause its gross.  okay, we owe you a present.  i will tell the story! it was going great. i let him win. wewere bonding. he even said i could call him dad.  daddy. all right look, heres the story.  well, we had just finishedplaying racquetball and we were gonna take a steam. i walk into the steam room and it wasreally steamy.  so i take off my glasses andthats when in happened.  guys?  i know.  why do they put so much steam in there?!  why? okay? why? wh-wh-why did that have to happen?  not that big a deal? therethere was touching of things.  i dont want him to tell this story for years.  if that is your father calling to tell this story then themarriage is off!  look, i figured i would try to convince him not to tell the storyanymore, and i figure the best way to do that is face to faceand by face idont mean his lap. and by face, i dont mean my ass.   so you understand, id feel a lot more comfortable if youdidnt tell people what happened. yknow, im a littleim alittle embarrassed about it.  what did you do when they found out?  so i guess we wear swimsuits in here!  that was one of the worse things ever. and not just on tv.  and say nothing?  secret? married people arent supposed to have secrets betweenone another. we have too much love and respect for one another.  no im serious, we should tell each other everything. i donot have any secrets from you.  okay.  so, ross and i are going to disneyland and we stop at thisrestaurant for tacos. and when i say restaurant, i mean a guy, a hibachi, and the trunk ofhis car. so ross has about 10 tacos. and anyway, were on space mountain andross starts to feel a little iffy.  no, he visited a little town south of throw up.  so what was phoebes secret?

thats almost rude, that im not.   ken, please! no, i cant, i cant smoke. if i smoke, my wife would kill me.  i always liked you, ken.   actually, in oklahoma smoking is legal in all commune areas and offices with fewer than fifteen people.  uch, do you think, monica is gonna be able smell it?  pheebs?   okay, something to cover the smell  oven cleaner!  unscented!   right. you know what? actually i just get off the plane, so im feeling kinda gross. maybe i should just take a shower.   alright, the truth is, i soiled myself during some turbulences.  yes, but i just had one. two. two tiny cigarettes. okay, five. a pack. two packaa carton. three big fat cartons in two days.  but its over, i made a decision, im not gonna smoke anymore.  i messed up, it was a meeting, everybody was smoking.  kay, look: can we just drop this? im not gonna smoke again.  you forbid me?  you know, i flew a long way t see my loving wife? is she here by the way?  oh, would you say this was the most upset you could be?  then, i might as well   do this . not really sure what to do now.  fine. what!?

 i feel so used.  i would never lie to get someone into bed.  i suppose that monica will have the  manipulative shrew.  you mean the lully story?  whats the matter with me? why im such a girl?  so you never had sex with a kennedy, have you?   hello?  hello?  honey, you're screaming.   funniest guy she's ever met!    i'm funny, right...? what do you know, you're a door... you just like knock-knock   jokes...  save it for   inside!   hey!  so... oklahoma is a crazy place. you know, they   call it the sooner state. frankly i'd sooner be in any other state.  and what's with oklahoma   having a pan handle? can all states have stuff like that? hey yeah, i'm from   the waistband, wyoming. but when i was seven, we headed over to the crotch.   and don't get   me started on the way that people from tulsa talk.  what's with the word y'all? you know, just... two   words just... pushed together... are we all allowed to do that, because if so,   i say why stop there? you know, your new poodle could be your noodle. and fried   chicken? could be fricken.waiter, waiter excuse me, i'll have the fricken?  see, that's... that's funny with the fricken, right?   were you there?  hey!  i need you to set me up for a joke. later, when monica   is around, i need you to ask me about fire trucks.   well, thank god your   livelihood doesn't depend on it.  monica says that her maitre d. is the funniest guy   she's ever met.  yes! am i crazy to be this upset?  yeah!  ye....   what are you guys talking about?  you got a man who's a nanny...? you got a manny...?     you know, i don't mind a... male nanny, but i do   draw the line at a male wetnurse.   if i'd known you guys were coming over, i would   have brought more pizza.   what is so funny about that?   oh yeah? is he funnier than me?  i do limericks... uhm... there once was a man named   chandler, whose wife made him die inside.  really...? see... that's the thing: you gotta keep   it smart, people!  i love you too.  and... i like you as a friend.    hi!  do you have any ideas?   oh, and you know whose knowledge   of her ex-boyfriend is shocking? monica!  so how come richard's selling the place? went bankrupt?   medical malpractice? choked on his own moustache?  no, no, no, no, no, no! no, no... we're not together.   we're not a couple. we're definately not a couple.  we're not gonna have this conversation again...   look at this place. why am i so intimidated by this guy? pretentious art, this   huge macho couch. when we know all he does is sit around all day crying about   losing monica to a real man!  you don't think he's here, do you?    look at these videos. you know, i mean,   who does he think he is? magnum force, dirty harry, cool hand luke... oh my   god!  there's a tape here with monica's name on it.  get there faster!   i'm not gonna watch it... i don't need to watch   it... i mean, what good could possibly come from watching?  well, we   know i'm gonna watch it.   don't judge me, i'm only human!  some girl...!?  allright, i'm gonna watch it... i mean look, it's   probably not even what i think it is... and even if it is... it can't possibly   be as bad as what i'm picturing in my head...  can it?  then you're gonna have to watch it for me.  just for a few seconds, so i can know what it is...   please?  it's football... it's just football... this is great!   this is the first time i've ever enjoyed football... it may be customary to   get a beer...    what the...    what are you doing?  whoho ho... listen to the judgement from the porn   star!  because that's who i am, okay? i'm sure a mature   man like richard could see a tape like that and it wouldn't bother him. just'd   be another saucy anecdote for him to share at his men's club over brandy and   moustaches.  oh, yeah, well, poor richard. y'... i can grow a   moustache!  yeah, oh, but i just keep picturing you rolling   around with him with your cowboy boots in the air...  oh, good, good. play more, 'cause i wanna see how   it ends.  what...? that's not you! life is good again! ride   'em cowgirl!  is that a problem?   yeah. hey, here's an idea, why don't we use our  wedding china today?  honey, she keeps canceling on us, take the hint.   what is the point of having them if we never use  them?  i will explain it to her.  aren't you one of the stars of the popular daytime  soap days of our lives?   well you proved them wrong.  oh suddenly, flowers are feminine?  i can't believe you'd want us to raise emma.   no, if crazy plate lad.. <sees monica frustrated  at this comment> if monica dies then i would get emma, right?  actually what?   what?  so if monica's not around, then i'm not good enough  to raise emma?   well what is wrong with me? am i .. am i incomptent?  because i managed to survive whatever it is that killed the three of you!   look, i may not know a lot about babies, but do  you really think i'm not capable?   ok. so if we both had emma and i die <knocks  on table>  she'd have to give her up.   so.. let me get this straight. so my two friends  die, i get emma. then my wife dies, then emma the one tiny ray of hope left  in my life gets taken away from me?  oh? did somebody miss me? is there a child to raise  poorly?   yeah but they're right. i mean, i'm not a strong  father figure and i never will be.   yeah, but its not who i am. everything they said  was exaclty why i was worried about having a kid. and its true. and look everybody  knows it.   oh yeah, well can you picture me saying \"go  to your room! you're grounded\"?   you said that to me last week.   alright! that is it. this is our apartment and  you can not behave this way. now if you can't act your age then you shouldn't  be here at all. now those plates may not be as nice as the pretty pink ones  i picked out, but they're very important to monica. i want you to apologize  to her right now.   okay. thats better. now i want you to both apologize  to each other and mean it.   by the way, that fight was totally arousing.   oh yeah? well thanks.   okay, but you should know he eats five times a  day and shoves pennies up his nose.   oh no no no.. i'll get her. i'm super-compentent  and totally responsibile and fourth in line to raise emma. i'll be right there  emma. just let me get my trusty diaper bag here. <knocks over the box of  china> well.. what do you know? i guess, i'll be the one who dies first.  yep...  maybe not even then.   yep.  that's a lot of cats jo lynn.  single are ya?  chandler bing.  what's up joe?  braid each other's hair and ride horseback on the beach?  that's so cool.  i'll let monica know.  joey just called.  he's got courtside knicks tickets for him and   me tomorrow night.  but hey, it's courtside.  the cheerleaders are going to be right   in fr. . .   that's not the way to convince you.   i know.  you're right.  i want to see you too.  i've just got to   figure out a way to tell joey, you know?  he's really looking forward to this.  yeah, ah, ah . . .  i'll think of something.  hey.    oh well, look at you.  well, it looks great.  it's just that . . . well, i'm wearing the   same thing underneath.  so . . .  see what i mean . . .    no, no, no, no, no.  joey can't know that i'm here.  because i didn't know how to tell him that i couldn't go to the knicks   game.  so, i just told him that i had to stay in tulsa.  you know, it's funny.  i've been, ah, practicing the art of seduction   myself.    hi ya.  yah.  it's joey.    hey joe.  look i, i can't.  what's going on?  no!  no! wait!   all right, look.  just stay there.  i'm   coming home.  is that really necessary?  don't you think it's better for him to think that you're cheating   on me, than for him to think that i'm cheating on him?    i heard it.  all right.  i've got a plan.  i'll go down the fire escape.  hear me out woman.  i'll go down the fire escape.  then, i'll wait   for a while.  then, when i come up the stairs, it'll be just like i just got   back from tulsa.  then, joey and i will come in and see that there's no guy   in here.  i'm just going to wait for a little while.  it's huge.   well, you're forgetting about the time difference.  joey said that you're in here with another man.   what is he doing?  all right.  well, i'll check the guest room.   i climb down the fire escape and you   can't put that in the closet?  i'm sorry.  i, i told you i was in tulsa because i wanted to spend   the night with monica and i, i didn't know . . .  i didn't think you'd understand.  i'm sorry.  that's the one thing i can't do.  i promised i'd be with   monica.  what?  you're gonna put on sweats and clean, aren't you?  okay, bye.  hey, listen.  i'm never going to lie to you again, okay?  and i want   you to know that nobody thinks you're stupid.  game's tomorrow night joe.  so, who does?  i'm sorry, i won't be here.  did i not mention that?   and to all a good night!   all right everybody, i know that it's christmas eve and you'd rather be with your families, but there's *no* call  for writing \"screw you, mr. bing!\" on the back of my chair!  -- by the way, you can all call me chandler.  hey. where've you been?   you hear that? you may not be with your families, but at least it's gonna smell like ham in here.  well, that's like money in your pocket! - alright look, you want me to say it? this sucks. being here sucks! this work sucks!  i'm sorry. hey, at least you guys get to go home and be with your families tonight. i have to go back to an empty hotel room and lay down on a very questionable bedspread. and then tomorrow morning, you get to have christmas morning in your own houses, wich, by the way, none of you have invited me to.  haha, no thanks!  oh, thanks! i'm... actually thinking about becoming a motivational speaker.  typical christmas-y stuff, you know? our holidays are pretty traditional...  i can save you time ladies, i'm right here.  what? that's terrible!  oh well, that, that makes it not terrible.  no not okay, you can't look for monica's presents!  why?  no, i have a great idea for a present for her.  if i help, we can find 'em faster!  ok, pheebs, your turn.  and, a lemon lime.  and last but not least.   ho, ho, ho! merry christmas!  well, i'm here to see my old buddy ben. what are you doing here, weird...turtle-man?  what?  you called everyone and said you were having trouble finding a santa costume, so i borrowed one from a guy at work!  but i didn't get to shake my belly like a bowl full of jelly.  fine, i'll give the suit back.  santa? really?  did your dad ever dress up like santa?  then it's okaaay!   you know what, everybody? go home. you should be with your families. it's bad enough that we're working new year's eve.  did i not tell *anyone* about new year's eve? -- alright, look, go! go home, okay? merry christmas! go.  good, god's speed, good people!  you're not gonna go?  ah. thanks.  ah.  chandler bing.  ahh, merry christmas; i miss you guys!  ah, well no, it's just uh, me and wendy.  it is. did i... not tell you about her?  i sent them home.  uhh, uh...  i don't know!  oh, she's regional vice president; she's... just below me.  be-low me!  well, she... she didn't win...  well, second prettiest that year; i mean, of *all* the girls in oklahoma, she's probably...  honey, there's really nothing to worry about.  i'm serious!  merry christmas.  merry christmas, you guys!   the wife says \"hi!\".  ah well, she's got this weird idea, that, uh, y'know, just because you and i are alone, that something is gonna happen.  this is probably the wrong thing to be worrying about, but... you're getting ham on my only tie.  whoa-ho, back off, missy!   i don't know; i'm not used to girls making passes at me! ...  wait a minute... am i sexy in oklahoma?   no,... no...  no!  look, i'm, i'm married!  i'm *happily* married.  right. so, i'm sorry...  well look, it's not easy to spend this much time apart, you know. she's entitled to be a little paranoid... or, in this case: right on money! ... you know, she's amazing, and beautiful, and smart, and if she were here right now, ...she'd kick your ass. look, you're a really nice person... ham stealing and adultery aside. but, what i have with my wife is pretty great, so nothing is ever gonna happen between us.  i mean, you were the most beautiful woman in the room tonight!  you kidding? you're the most beautiful woman in most rooms...   whoa! whoa! whoa! what's going on? you and i just made out! you and i are making out?  how drunk are you?   that's the perfect amount!  what?  i know.  well, i have kissed over four women.  do you wanna get under the covers?  okay!  it bodes well for me that speed impresses you.  yep!  two!  eh!   so, are you really gonna go out with that nurse man?  y'know, i don't know if you've ever looked up the term goofing around in the dictionary... well, i have, and the technical definition is, two friends who care a lot about each other and have amazing sex and just wanna spend more time together. but if you have this new fangled dictionary that gets you made at me, then we have to, y'know, get you my original dictionary. i am *so* bad at this.  really? okay, so...  y'know, i sensed that i should stop. so we're okay?  right!  okay, all right, all right, all right! okay!  okay, here's something, here's something blue and new.  let's go!   oh, okay, i have condom in my wallet that i've had since i was twelve.  i don't think so.   here just...take this.   no, we'll-we'll bring it back! just put it under your dress.  okay, one thing at a time.   ehh.  look, i thought about it too, and i'm sorry. i think we should spend all of the money on the wedding.  yeah, i'm putting my foot down. yeah look, when i proposed i told you that i would do anything to make you happy, and if having the perfect wedding makes you happy, then, then that's what we're gonna do.  eh, forget about the future and stuff! so we only have two kids, y'know? we'll pick our favorite and that one will get to go to college.  yeah.  uh, four, a boy, twin girls and another boy.  well, stuff like where we'd live, y'know? like a small place outside the city, where our kids could learn to ride their bikes and stuff. y'know, we could have a cat that had a bell on its collar and we could hear it every time it ran through the little kitty door. of course, we'd have an apartment over the garage where joey could grow old.  sure you do.  you sure?  i love you so much.  hey!  i wanted to be with you. i missed you so much.  monica.  i never want to leave you again!  turns out they can't fire me. because i quit.  yeah! it's a stupid job, and i could not stand leaving you. and why should i be the only one who doesn't get to do what he *really* wants to do?   i have *not* thought this through!  i know, i, i should have talked to you first about it.  thanks!   ahh...   here, pass these, will ya..   i... thought it was a timely start to thinking about other people. besides, this gift still says i love you guys.  i don't have a *job*!  hey!  i've got nowhere to go this morning. i'm unemployed! i don't know what i'm gonna do with my life.  i mean, what am i supposed to do with myself?   but it's all so overwhelming. i don't know where to start.   hey! this is where your hyper-organized-pain-in-the-ass stuff pays off!  how long was i in there?  wait. advertising! that's a great idea!  i don't think i have to hear the rest. advertising makes perfect sense. sorry you had to waste all this time, though.  i mean, i can write slogans. i mean, how hard can it be, right? \"cheese. it's milk that you chew.\" \"crackers. because your cheese needs a buddy.\" \"a grape. because who can get a water melon in your mouth?\"  honey? leave it to the pros.  \"the phone. bringing you closer to people...who have phones.\"  it's funny. when you said \"unpaid\" it sounded like you said \"unpaid.\"  actually, we're trying, and i don't think monica's gonna wanna postpone it. we're supposed to have sex tonight. actually, she's probably at home naked right now. i tend to keep talking until somebody stops me. i can just picture her on the bed right now.  whatever i decide to do, i'm gonna be starting a career from scratch. it's gonna be a while before i make a living at it. maybe now is not the right time to be starting a family.  yeah.   yeah, ross is here so...  hey.  oh, yeah. but you have to give it back if i get a job. of course, by that time in the future ties will be obsolete and we'll all be wearing silver jump suits.  that thing that i have to do to make a baby. i faked it.  oh yes you can. you just make the faces and the noises.   that's actually why. look, i'm starting a whole new career now, and i'm not saying that i don't want to have a baby,i'm just saying maybe we could wait a little while.  it could be less than a year. i mean, you've heard my stuff. \"pants. like shorts, but longer.\" it'll probably be more than a year.   yeah, me too. look, i'll just get my old job back.   i quit and you learn what i do?  i guess. it's always gonna be scary when we have a baby.   oh, and i promise, i will not fake it this time.  hey  yes, bravo on the hot nanny.  i wasn't staring. i was leering.  looks like joey is doing allright with her.  seriously dude, 3 years ago.  you don't trust him?  is this really your long term plan, for me to run interference?   because i could get a job any day now.  allright, fine, but don't blame me if it doesn't work. because you know   as well as i do that once joey sets his mind on something, more often than not,   he's going to have sex with it.  where you going, joe?  your thoughts? plural?  i'm afraid i can't let you do that, joe.  yes, as a matter of fact he did, so i can't let you go.  great novels?    i'm sorry, i got a little occupied.   right behind you, big guy!     first i was afraid, i was petrified    hi  oh, well someone left this . this is yours?  oh, uh, well, i haven't seem it but if i do i'll let you know.  hey!  sure! just give me a second to get all huffy and weird like you! do you believe that who everdid something over here last night did what they did or didn't do ...i mean come on!!  no!  our balcony? seriously? that's so funny because i told monica we should put lights on our balcony. and she said\"no, no. it's too cold, nobody will go out there.\" and i said \"maybe if we put some light out there they will\"  so are you gonna...talk to her?  you know when \"that's fine\" sounds true when someone yells it and spits!  no no no. good. so you're moving on? do you have any idea where you're moving?  dude, don't rub my face in your crazy single life!  why did i get married?!  hey it's the most eligible man in ny. how's the moving on going?  well maybe you're going about this the wrong way. you know i mean think about it. single white male, divorced three times,two illegitimate children. the personal ad writes itself....  what are doing? you know i can only dish it out!  maybe she didn't move on, you know...maybe that kiss was just an impulsive one-time birthday thing  did she go out with him?  are you trying to get everybody divorced?  i thought i had to make the jokes!  oh come on! hello! hi! my name is chandler, here's my friend ross right here, and we were wondering you know if you're up for it. we only need six more people for a human pyramid...swoop!! swoop!!  we still got it!  i don't get it neither, i mean you're obviously desperate, you're asking women how they want to be killed  by drowning or...?!  well...  wow, it seems serious. what seems to be the problem, ashley judd?  its like a baby caterpillar chasing its mama!  ok. first of all, this is green!  ok, you know how most kids get their allowance from mowing the lawn or taking out the garbage, well i earned mineby plucking the eyebrows of my father and his business partners.  yeah, well, i guess you dont need my help victor victoria!  oh, not with my combination of ice cubes, aloe vera and my gentle self-loathing touch.  and done!  thanks. you wanna see what it looks like?  yeah, yeah, i think it looks pretty good. i was a little worried i was uncovering a birthmark right aboutthere, but it turned out to be a little piece of chocolate.  yeah.  i am sorry i am late. youll understand when youll see joey.  really? in front of all this people?  oh my god!  i gotta stop this.  jeremiah was a bullfrog. was a good friend of mine, never understood a single word he said, but i helped himdrink his wine. so you just touch yourself for anything?  see, now, why would you assume that? just because we're married?      i will have you know that we are very hip, happening people. now, if you'll      excuse me, i have to get back to reading the obituaries.  wow.  well, i think it's great that you're going on a date, you know? i      mean, it sounds healthy. i mean, you have needs. embrace your womanhood!  emma? emma? look at me! well, i think i'll go downstairs for a while.  no, no, no, no! no, no, no, no! it's okay, it's okay. i didn't go.      don't cry, it's just a bit! i'm your uncle chandler; funny is all i have!  i don't do that.  i'll try to stop. wait, did you say until the sixth?  today is the sixth.  yes, it's also 2003.  it's okay. go take the test and see if we're okay.  i might have checked to see if i was ovulating a couple times.  i am not working. there's not much to do around here!  oh, good, because as of four o'clock this afternoon, i am not.   i - i don't think i can.  because of emma.  well, i can't say \"hump\" or \"screw\" in front      of the b-a-b-y.  horrifying? scarring? something people go to jail for?  you guess i'm right? when we stayed at that bed and breakfast, you      wouldn't have sex with me because you thought a deer was staring through      the window.  emma was doing it!  okay, i'll try. and you can't make any noise.  i think we may have really done it this time.  you may wanna get some more of those too.  don't ask me, i was in there canoodling you!  okay.   all right, all right, we were. we were trying to make a baby. monica's      ovulating.  no, no, no.  what? why?  your family name is tribbiani.   guys, guys, i've got great news! guess what  thank you. i got a job in advertising.   right. so, it'll be the same except less sex with you.   well, it's a training program, but at the end, they hire the people they like.   humiliating and noble!   good morning, everybody.  oh, no, no, i'm an intern, just like you guys except for the tie, the briefcase and the fact that i can rent a car.  yeah, well, i'm kinda heading into a new career direction and, you know, you gotta start at the bottom.  right. look, i know i'm a little bit older than you guys, but it's not like i'm bob hope    the comedian? uso?!   honey, i'm old!  i am so much older than these other interns. i can't compete with them.  yes, but i don't think life experience with these.   they're these prototype sneakers and come up with ideas on how to sell them which i can't do because no self-respecting adult would ever where these.  what am i supposed to do with these?  well, first of all, they're not called \"sneakers\" anymore. apparently, they're called \"kicks\" or \"skids\" and i think i heard somebody say \"slorps\".  and here, look: they've got these wheels to pop out from the bottom so you can roll around 'cause, apparently, walking is too much exercise. kids, kids, roll your way to childhood obesity!  would you help me try to sell these?  no, i don't think that's the kinda thing they're looking for.   hey!  putting on the sneakers thought i'd get into a younger mindset, you know, to see if it sparked anything  yes, how's this: they're so uncomfortable it's like getting kicked in the nuts for your feet!   you know what these aren't half-bad!  you should suggest something like these to ralph lauren.  alright  i feel youger already!   oh, thank you, sir or man-who's-two-years-younger-than-me    i don't know, i don' i don' know! i was just trying to get into a young mindset, you know, and it just started to flow.  the cold weather hurts my hip!  did you see our bank statement? can this be right?  i'm not sure what they did, but i'm inclined to blame enron.  maybe i should quit and get a job that pays.  you know what? you know what? i think we're making too big a deal  out of this. ok? so we pay our bills a little late this month and maybe next  month we cut back on a few things. and maybe we start eating out of joey's  refrigerator for a change. you're chef... what can you make out of backing  soda and beer?  because we don't do that. we are bings! and if there's one thing  my father taught me was... well to always knock before going into the pool  house... but the other thing was never borrow money.  that's right! i do! and i'm your man. and i'm going to get us through  this situation even if it means you working twice as hard.  yeah.... she's not so cute.  yes dear.  hey joe!  listen er..i need to ask you a favor but you can't tell monica anything  about it.  and that would have made the official party line.  monica  and i are having a little financial trouble.  what? what do you mean you know?  oh! right.  yes! two thousand dollars exactly! how do you know that!   listen...this is really nice. do you...   did you write a cheque to monica for two thousand dollars?  did monica borrow money from you?  i can't believe her! did she tell you we were having money problems?  what?  what would she get for herself for two thousand dollars that she  wouldn't tell me about?  hey rach! there she is...my perfectly proportioned wife.  oh no..don't thank me. thank you. you know there's not one thing  i would change about you? not one single thing! and definitely not... two...  single things.  no no! i just love the way you look, i am warm, for your form.  well yes yes... you look nice can mean that your face looks nice.  i want to compliment your body. i mean..i wouldn't change it. at all. and more  specifically, i wouldn't want anything to get any bigger.  i mean, you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger would  you? don't answer that.  hey rach! ah........ perfection.  wouldn't change  a thing. not a thing.  yeah?  but honey you don't have to.  they...do that?  well! we er..climbed up four flights of stairs, manueveored a narrow  hallway, dodged a rabid pitbul... but these last three feet are where it gets  really tricky.  aaaaand....... hernia.  ah, look on the bright side, i mean you won't have to live with  this ugly chair! that was here already huh? i love you.   hey! ready to go?  great, a faster way to tell people that i'm unemployed and childless .  the tall girl who wouldn't sleep with you?  bet she'd sleep with you now...   let me see what you wrote about yourself: \"doctor paleontology, two kids... \"  you split with carol because you have different interests?... i think you split with carol because you've one very similar interest!  maybe we finish this for him!  \"also i cloned a dinosaur in my lab. she's now my girlfriend. i don't care what society says. it's the best sex i've ever had\"... aaand send!  oh, i'm so sorry!  you're not gonna need my help?  oh good, 'cause i've already thought of 3... 4! i've just thought of a fourth   i respectfully disagree.  who cares? nobody reads those things  i don't have a page.  because i told everyone he slept with dinosaurs.  would you get that please? people have been calling to congratulate me all day.  hang up, hang up. and that was a great movie!  i'm so gonna get back at ross... oh yeah, this will show him, here we go .  oh, you'll see my friend.  well, how you died was funny.  it kills over one americans every year.  you wanna talk about people's feelings? you should have heard how hurt professor stern was yesterday when i told him i wouldn't be able to go with him to key west!  no, come on, you know that's not true.  well, the gay community is a lot more vocal than the dead community.  alright look, let's think about this, ok, do you really think that people are gonna stir up your family at this tragic time? that people are gonna post condolences on a website? this is not about people not caring that you're dead .this is about people not having a decent outlet for their grief.  right, i mean, come on, i'm sure that if you had a funeral or a memorial service, tons of people would come.  ross, what're you... what're you... what are you doing? you're having a memorial service for yourself!?  ross, don't press send, don't press se... !   please, come in.  oh yes, yes... let me... take your coat.  at least he died doing what he loved... watching blimps   some guy, tom gordon.  ok!   please, one ridiculous problem at a time!  you gave them one day's notice, not everyone in our class checks the web site everyday and monica... it's probably the way you stand!  oh, that's not true. you had an impact on me, i mean, it's 15 years later and we're still best friends. doesn't that count for something?  i'm sure it's somebody for you. now, go hide.   kori? kori weston?  chandler, chandler bing. i'm not gay, i'm not gay at all.  don't listen to him, he's in a really bad mood!   i didn't know ross and you were so close.  i'm sure that would mean a lot to him. and if heaven has a door, i'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently.  yeah, because if i was at my old job we'd say 300million? no thank you!  still on amelia earhart?  pie eating contest?  no, i saw a picture of you covered in blueberries.  damnit. alright call me whenyou know more.  sense the tone! no that kid nate got it.  yeah i know.  yeah...i mean i want this so much! i mean, i wannaget one, i want my friend charlie to get one...except i don't careabout charlie.  i can see the headline now: \"lottery winners' friendfilled with regret eats own arm\".  well you wouldn't, but we own the paper, we canprint whatever we want.  ok, so now that you're in, what are you gonna do ifwe win?  ooh! calm down ...  you know, i'm not sure a sports team is the way togo.   i'll take this one too  uh... mommy?  hello? hello? oh, hey charlie. did anybody elsehear? ... what? susan got it?? how? oh man, i would have slept withhim!! .. alright, bye.   well no, charlie's gonna get that.  he's the boss's son.  what about the ones you have on the nightstand?  yes there are, i just saw them a few minutes ago.  honey, there are like 20 tickets on the nightstand!   she's right, you shouldn't have boughttickets just for us ...  let me finish ...  however, itdoesn't look like i'm gonna get this job so i can't afford to haveprinciples, so screw you, the tickets are ours!!   oh, yeah! thanks for inventing the lottery!   hey, there's twomessages. these could be from work!  ok, here we go!   oh, is she related to ralph lauren?  i got that!  ah, the \"i'm sorry i rejected you\" phone call. i'mnot used to getting it from guys.  hey, steve.  me, that guy who just said butt cracks?  what?  oh, yeah, i'm gonna be a juniorcopywriter.  does that mean i get the good loving tonight?  thanks, man.  really? what?  wow, you'd think we should get that over 20 years orgo for the big payout.  me too.  so, what do you say? can you get out of work?  are you really that busy?  oh, that's ok.i'll just try and reschedule.  \"hi, this is chandler bing. i made a reservation there and i need to change it  oh, what do you mean it's not refundable? can i just come some other time?  oh, can't you make an exception?\"   \"look, this is ridiculous! i'm not paying for that room! ok?\"  \"oh, thank you very much!\"  yeah, i'm going to vermont...  i don't have travel insurance.  new york.  i'm sorry, he's a little bit wound up, we had to stop at every maple candy stand on the way here.  just give us the cheapest room you have.  that's insane!  does that room have a closet i can lock him in?  we'll take it.  great, at a hundred dollars an apple, we're there!  dude, you're shaking!  usa today  and i also got... two more apples.  i also got this great salt and pepper shaker from the restaurant.  i think i know what you mean though...the lamp is the hotel's, but the bulbs ...oh, you already got that.  ok, how about this ?  yes, but the batteries...  thank you, thank you very much!  no!  oh we did, and you still have all your lamps.  oh, i didn't factor in the room tax.  look, we have enough, just walk away.  there's a forest right outside.  i got you something from vermont!    well, let me see... i-i believe i'm... yes, falling asleep in front of the tv.  i could fall asleep at a play.   uh, let's see, who do i hate?  hey!   no, i think we're just blurry shapes to him now.   oh yes, god yes!!  i... i don't know... you seem lovely.   so, how did you enjoy the play?  well you should be. you missed the most powerful three hours in the history of the theater.  oh yeah, i had no idea the amazing journey you go through as a woman! tell me, tell me about your first period!  did somebody sign your bra?  oh well, this was a really important experience for me, and i wanted to share it with you.  i missed most of the party  charlie's a girl, right?   so, a professor, uh?  oh, yeah?  oh, well... maybe we could...   we really need to take those tests?  it's weird! in a doctor's office?   i cannot believe ross told you that!    and in my defense, it was a wendy's!  oh, yeah! rachel talks too!  i have a weird feeling about this place.  how do i   know that they are not gonna secretly videotape me and put it all over the internet.  yeah, i guess!  oh, come on!  why are you here?  what!?  i'd love to stay, but i have eh...  got   a hot date...    i think it just fell off.    my specimen is in the   room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there.   really helped speed the process along!  janice! you're not... gone?  yeah! yeah... the hard part is over!   oh, oh, yeah, ok, thanks. i can't believe   i didn't even think of that. i guess i was just so worried about having to...   come here and do... 'that'...   it was a \"wendy's!!   \"   it is not okay that i'm aroused by this now.  hello? oh hi, doctor connelly.  no, she's not here   but, you know, i can tell her. should i be sitting down for this?  oh.  well, so what does that mean?    ok. ok, thank you. thanks.   doctor connelly just called.  actually it's both of us.  apparently my sperm have low motility and you have an inhospitable   environment.   it means that we can keep trying, but there's   a good chance this may never happen for us.  i'm sorry.  well, we're gonna... we're gonna figure this out.   wow! fortunately she has a very pretty face!  oh, i can't believe my sperm have low motility because, let me tell you, when i was growing up they sure seem to be in a hurry to get places!!  hi.  oh, damn it!  i think i can safely say that we all have family issues, work stuff and/or are sick.  but you come first!   ok.  not as much fun as last time. apparently you only get porn if you're giving a sperm sample.  well... there's surrogacy, but monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child, she has felt that watching a surrogate would be... too hard for her.  yeah.  aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination, so... we're talking about sperm donors.   ah-ha!  you guys haven't actually met before, but, boy! you're both polite!  go to have a seat zack, and i'll get you a beer.   so, zack's pretty nice, uh?  so, how would you like to have a baby that's half yours and half his!  well, we're talking about sperm donors and zack may be the guy! i mean, look, he's intelligent, he's healthy, he's athletic, i mean, he is \"spermtastic\"!  no, i invited him to dinner so you could get a chance to get to know him! i mean, if we go through a sperm bank you never meet the guy, get to check him out.  ok!   zack!  so what do you think? i want that guys genes for my kid! those eyes, those cheeckbones!  you don't like him.  alright! just follow my lead!   that's really not the kind of thing we are looking for zack.  you know what's not funny? male pattern baldness   i noticed you were enjoying that ravioli with a beautiful set of teeth. did you have braces as a child?   we're teeth people zack!  are you just tired now or are you always tired, 'cause that could be a sign of clinical depression.  ok.  i think we've found our sperm!  yeah, you think so, well? should i ask him?   thank god, because i don't wanna do this either. you know, i was just doing because i thought that was what you wanted to do. you know, i'm the husband, i'm supposed to... bring the sperm.  so you know this leaves us with...  me too. i wanna find a baby that needs a home and i wanna raise it with you. and i wanna mess it up in our own specific way.   yeah.  hey, zack!  really?  my wife and i have some boundary issues, you know, sometimes we ask inappropriate questions. we're working on it.  you wouldn't know if jeanette's planning on keeping her baby, would ya?  yeah ross, i mean... we're excited to hear the speech but the rest of the time we're gonna wanna do, you know, \"island's stuff\".   she does?  i wouldn't read too much into it.  david, let me stop you there 'cause i think i see where this is going. i'm not very good at giving advice. so if you want advice, go to ross, monica, or... joey, if the thing you wanna advice about is pizza toppings or burning sensation when you pee.  seriously, we're gonna do this?  what?  i didn't mean now...  david, i'm pretending to read here!!   i do! want a hint? huh? \"i do\"  \"i do\".  man, that's some bad advice!  that's why our honeymoon photos look like me and diana ross!   nice!   monica, can i talk to you for a sec?   david is going to propose to phoebe tonight!  that would be advice!!   what?  may i?   oh, no, no, no dear god, no!  your computer, i don't know wha... everything's gone!  it must be a virus. i think it erased your hard drive.  someone i don't know sent me an e-mail and i opened it.  well, it didn't say \"this is a virus\"!!  nude... ... pictures of anna kournikova. i'm so sorry.  well, you must be pretty mad at yourself right now...!  well, i tried billy jean king, but...  you know, you and monica have the same \"i'm gonna kill you\" look...? i can usually make it go away by kissing her...   and there's not chance that will work?   oooooooh! meddler! meddler!  this vacation sucks!!  you know, it's very hard to take you seriously when you look like that.  i think we have some time. have you ever heard him talk?  \"uh, phoebe, uh, i would be honoured, uh...\" spit it out, david!  i wouldn't brag too much about that thing, big guy.  hey! remember when i had corneas?  ladies? ross's speech is in 45 minutes.   not to mention the cold sores.   really?  i don't think so!  because you know how competitive you get and well, i say it's cute, others disagree, and i'm lying!  oh, yeah? what happened when we played last time?  and...?  she gets crazy! this scar  is from pictionary!   oh dear god, there's two of them!   did you know this about him?   ok!  honey, try to focus the trash talk on him!  i think this is the first time in our marriage that i've felt like the more attractive one.  okay-dokay, you've each won a game and i've lost what's felt like a year of my life. so everybody goes home a winner.  should i use my invisibility to fight crime or for evil?   ok, look! enough is enough!  monica, that was also true an hour ago! i mean, please, look at you! your hand is blistered, you can barely stand, your hair is inexplicable! ok, you've already proven you are just as good as he is, now we've missed our dinner reservations, so now let's just go upstairs, order room service, take a shower and shave your head!  but...  what about the obsessive cleaning?  you ok?  because i'm gonna play for ya.   yes, i do. now, i may not understand why you have to win so badly, but if it's important to you then it's important to me, because i love you.  all right mike, let's get this over with. sudden death. whoever wins this point, wins.  and that's... how... it's done!  i never sucked, i actually didn't want you to know how good i was!  i don't know.  you know, i'd love to, but i'm a little tired.  she's cheating on joey with ross!  wow!  how about the dinosaur twins in the other room?  no-one is manning that wall!  anything?  you do realise  that's your brother?  that's not true. i came with monica and i'm leaving  with weird al.  okay buckwheat!   bye!  he's probably in his room with his current girlfriend  charlie. that's the situation as we know it...   you got it!  okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you  do one thing for us? the people that  care about you?  enunciate!  hey!  not quite. monica's still at the salon, and i'm  just finishing packing.  you're not supposed to take that. besides, it's  a new testament, what are you gonna do with it?  hey!... aaaaaahhhh!  i think.... i think i can see your scalp.  wish i could switch with someone. i really don't  wanna sit with allen iverson over there.  you go back to work tomorrow night, right?  what are you singing?  it's \"ride of the valkyries\" from \"apocalypse  now\"...  see, here's the thing: the corn rose were really a solution to your frizzy  hair problem. and now that we're home, we don't have that problem anymore,  so if you think about it... i hate them!  did i? let's refresh. i believe what i said was  that i could see your scalp.  again, let's journey back... as i recall what rachel  said, was  she had never notice the shape of your skull before. and joey...  well, joey didn't realise that there was anything different.  hit yourself in the tooth?  honey, you've been in there for a long time...  is everything okay?  really? what happened?  you can't move at all?  if i untangle you, will you please get rid of thecorn rose?   some of these look a little  frayed.  now that i untangled you, how 'bout you doing a  little something for me?  this is what i want to do.   she's an  fbi agent, posing as a beauty contestant.  there's a hair in my coffee.  i mean, you have a lovely home.  that's great.  can i see the book?  you want me to wash my hands first, don't you?  hey, you must be owen.  i'm chandler. hey, i was in the scouts too.  yeah, in fact my father was a den-mother.  you know how to use a compass?  you do? that's fantastic!  i'd love to, but i gotta get back to talking to your  parents. they're telling us all about how they adopted you.  what?  where are bill and colleen?  i didn't get to the bathroom. i bumped into owen on the way,  and he didn't know he was adopted. and there's a slight chance i may  have told him.  but kids are so intuitive. don't you think on some level he  already knows?  which technically now you should give back!  i'm so sorry, but you should have a sign out there or  something. or at least whisper it to people when they come in the  door. \"owen doesn't know he's adopted, and he also thinks that santa  is real.\"  we have to get out of here, baby!  owen didn't know he was adopted, and monica told him.  yeah, but how would you like it if someone told the triplets  that you gave birth to them?  i'm gonna go tell emma she was an accident.   so, you and rachel tonight, huh?  wow! so tonight may be the night! you're nervous?  what must it be like not to be crippled by fear  and self-loathing.  how can you be so confident?  really? like you have a routine?  ...and beer!!  hey! stop staring at my wife's legs! no no! stop  staring at your sister's legs!  she went on one of those spray-on tan places.   why...why?  sure, then you should get a mini skirt so you can  really show it off.  hey pheebs!  who's amanda?  just so i know, how many more of those can i expect?  no, had it done to me though. feels good !  hang on, she’s right here.  someone's on the phone, for ya.   i get pedicures!  was that place... the sun?  oh my god! you can do a duet of ebony and ivory  all by yourself!  how was your date with joey?  you didn't like that?   you don't  know!   if she asks, i protested a little, but ok!  well, aren't you a treat.  that fake british woman is a real bitch, but she  sure can dance... hey!  actually, no. no, it felt right. you know, it felt  like uhm... i can't believe we haven't been doing this the whole time.  i can tell from your expressions that that's the  good news you were hoping for... well, i'm gonna go continue to... spread the  joy.  dude, it's chandler. let me in.  i know, i went to the tanning place and the same  thing happened to me. you have to let me in.  no, i just had to get a picture of this.  honey, i got us that room at the woodford inn this weekend.  there's this thing i really want us to do. i read about it in maxim...  fine, but if we end up not doing this maxim thing because of this   party...  hey hey! where's the birthday girl?  oh, sure, she was probably up all night, excited about the party   she knows is happening.  i'm not going to vermont with this monica!  hi emma! it's the year 2020. are you still enjoying your nap?  we used to be married, but then we missed a weekend away together   and things kind of unraveled. because of you! happy birthday.   was that emma? is she up?   i don't know! you'll tell us on monday!   you do know, i can just turn them the other way around, right?  i'm begging you stop.  thats a bear.  ok, on your mark... get set... go!!!  i bought you. how did i forget that that's all you do?  they left.  i'm sorry, is this a game for emma or for monica?  ooh! that's my girl!  did i teach her that? did i just... impart wisdom?  me too...  i was kidding.  no, not yet.  hey, guys! come on! you gotta see what emma just did.  emma, how old are you? how old are you today?   let's do it, come on!  thanks!  joey, we would've asked you, we just thought you wouldn't be interested.  so excited about your letter!  that's where people make number two!!   i don’t... uh... understand.  on every word?  and that became ‘they are humid prepossessing homo sapiens   with full sized aortic pumps...?  i doubt that! tell her about us lastyear.  word!  oh, i don't think it was desperate, i think it was amazing!  sounds good to me... but what would a guy think?   hey joe! how's the second draft of the letter coming?  can we read it? can you print out another copy?   hello, this is chandler bing. somebody just dropped   off a handwritten recommendation letter, and..  uh-huh... uh-huh...   okay... thank you. good-bye. .   they loved it.  they thought it was very smart of us to have a  child write the recommendation letter.  i think she looks cute.    ... but i am wrong!  like war. or that thing in joey's refrigerator. remember? it was   in a milk carton but it looked like meat?  hey! monica can be cool and fun at organized indoor projects!  hey, i'm sorry, i should have given you guys my   black book when i got married! although it wasn't so much a book as a... napkin.   with janice's phone number on it.  is monica not here?  oh, then i'll tell you. my agency was bidding for  a big account and they got it! it's my first national commercial!  yeah, and i don't wanna brag but a lot of the ideas   were mine!  hell, you weren't there? all the ideas were  mine!!!  oh... i don't know, i really don't think you're   right for the part.  first of all. bravo. uh, but i really don't think   you're right for this. the part calls for a stuffy college professor.  software that facilitates inter-business networking   e-solutions?  joe, i told you, you're just not right for   the part.  fine!  work, joe!  what am i gonna do now?  he's not right for the part. so if i suggest   him, my bosses are gonna think i'm an idiot! and that's something they should   learn on their own!  that's good! i liked it, they didn't.    joey, for god's sake,   go to work! .  hey joe!  bad news. i watched the tape and passed it along   to my bosses and they weren't interested.   what!? of course i did!  i'm not lying to you, i watched it!  i watched it!    i did!   i'm telling you, i watched the tape.       no!  i can't believe joey. i hate being called a liar!  what did i just say?  yes, and i have to say, i am not just hurt. i am   insulted. when i tell somebody i did something...  why are you so sure i didn't watch this tape?  he really is a chameleon.  lying is wrong!  i'm a pretty little girl.  that's funny, we were doing the same thing!  yeah it is really pricey. i mean, i freaked when i first heard the   numbers.   maybe you do that next time you get married!  hey!  our adoption social worker is coming by today so we are cleaning   the apartment.  kind of. she's coming by to interview us and see where we live.   little people?  what...? no!  but you already gave all your money to charity!  i don’t think you can do that!  but other than that... wholesome, wholesome building.  of course it was!  rat bastard!  oh, it's just some crazy guy who roams the halls here. he's great   with   oh, just like i said. that crazy... bert... roaming the halls. (joey   bangs on   we'll talk to you later, bert. everythng's fine!!   oh yeah! he has a caretaker. his older brother... ernie.   you can't make this stuff up!  what the hell are you doing?  well, we're not.  we don't have a code word.  any room that isn't behind this couch!    you have to get out of here. you slept   with   ok!  what?  and for the last time, we do not want to be friends with you! and   we don't want to buy your bat!   i can explain... joey...  oh, that's really ok.  wrong number?  that's great!  hello...? have you seen joey's bat?  yeah. we don't feel like we can host thanksgiving this year.  well, it's just with uhm, work and the stress of adoption, we just don't feel like we have the energy. plus, we don't think it's fair that every year the burden falls on us.   no, no! we made this decision together.   don't let yourself get manipulated this way!  we are supposed to make these decisions together! did you not watch the doctor phil i taped for you?  why come all the way from kansas to do that?  you know what just occurred to me? this could be our last thanksgiving just the two of us. i mean, we could be getting a baby soon!  somebody is gonna pick us.   i'm telling ya! it's gonna happen. next year it's gonna be you, me and the little hemingway bing.  what, he's my favourite author!   \"the firm\"?  i'm serious, let me do something, just not the turkey or the stuffing, nothing \"high profile\".  tell me more.  you obviously haven't tasted my palmolive potatoes!  oh my god!  hmm, the game's at one.  dinner is at four, we'll never gonna make it back.  you say that now, but it could take us a long time to get back home. plus joey could get lost and and they could have to page us to go pick him up.  look, monica has been working hard all day, she didn't wanna host this thing in the first place, we shouldn't go!  i can't believe they are not here! i slave and i slave for what? they've ruined cranberry day!   they're out there!   everything is so distorted! looks like joey has a giant hand! which says \"rangers\" on it. they went to the game!   ross' shirt is torn.   oh thank god!   that's a lie, you went to the game, i can see joey's hand.  guys, i'd listen to her. the vein is bigger than i've ever seen it.   ha-ha! all you got was monica's stinky brussels sprouts!  the cranberries...?  well, you manheads aren't any better. you lied about going to the game. you knew it would make you late, and you still went anyway.  that would be a lot more convincing if you weren't drooling.  a little late for that.  uhm, we've got turkey grease.   oh, i left them on my bulldozer... i don't have tools!  come on guys, push!   look! look! look what the... look what... look what the floating heads did!  what's going on?  and?  are you serious?   that is the exact same thing.   hi!  we're just here to say goodbye, we're off to ohio.  yeah. i mean, this girl could decide against adoption or she could like another couple better..  so we're standing firm on the 'not getting our hopes up'?  yes, but...  oh, screw it, i'm gonna be a daddy!!  yeah. just weird, you know. it's like: \"hi, i'm chandler. may i have the human growing inside you?\"  ok.   i don't think that's exactly...  so, the fact that i am a doctor, and my wife’s a reverend, that’s important to you?  plus i thought the baby would be in good hands with a doctor!  yeah, wow.  no-ot for me it doesn’t.  yeah, actually. so, you read a file that you liked and you gave the agency the serial number and they contacted us?  you should be. you’re really on top of stuff..  yeah, i did.  we are not signing those papers.  it's wrong. they made a mistake. they think we're somebody else.  you have gotta stop!  she likes doctor chandler and reverend monica.  your veal chop is $34,95!  but we are not the one she chose! how can you feel okay about this?  i know..  monica, i want a baby too, but this woman is giving away her child. she deserves to know who it's going to.   so, we'll tell the truth and who knows, maybe she'll like us for us.  you're jewish.  hey.  the agency must have made some mistake. my wife is not a reverend and i'm not a doctor.  i could perform an operation on you and prove it if you'd like.  well, our names really are monica and chandler. we're from new york.  you have every reason to be upset. we did lie. but only because we've been waiting and trying to have a baby for so long. now we don't know how long it's gonna be before we can get another chance again.  erica, please. just consider us. ask them to see our file. our last name's bing. my wife's a chef and i'm in advertising.  but you did like us. and you should. my wife's an incredible woman. she's loving and devoted and caring. and don't tell her i said this but the woman's always right... i love my wife more than anything in this world. and i... it kills me that i can't give her a baby... i really want a kid. and when that day finally comes, i'll learn how to be a good dad. but my wife... she's already there. she's a mother... without a baby... please?  you still want that baby?   seriously, answer faster!   it's like a giant hug.  oh, uhm... i have to work too. yeah, i'm stuck at the office all day.  those are all really old!  hi!  i was in the car with nancy all day.  well, at least the perfume is not mine, be thankful for that!  it’s perfect. it’s everything we’ve been looking for.  and the wiggle wharms and the zip zorps?  what were the things you said?  and the fireplace in the bedroom.  this is bringing out a lovely color in you!  i don’t know. what do you think?  i do too.  i know.  i don’t know what you mean, giant talking cigarette! oh, by the way, phoebe called just as i was getting into nancy’s car, so if she asks you, i was at work all day.  hey!  is it me, or have the greetings gone downhill around here?  yeah  i'm not having an affair. nancy is our realtor.  ...and a street where our kids can ride their bikes and maybe an ice-cream truck can go by.  actually, we already found a house we love.  i know this is really hard and we're really sorry.   you know that's not the reason joe.   if you win, we give up the birds.  but if we win, we get your apartment.  dangerous liaisons.  fancy.  fancy guest.  thanks man.  well, i think, i think ross knows about me and monica.  no problem roomie.   sure!  hello? it's nancy, they responded to our offer.   okay, thanks...  they passed. they said they wouldn't go a penny under the asking price.  i know.  that's okay, we understand.  yeah... well, it's a good thing we got it then.  we got the house.  i just didn't want to tell you in front of them.  we're getting the house.  we're getting the house.  we're growing up.  so who's gonna tell them?  not it! damn it!  well, i didn't know how to tell you before, but... we got the house.  what did i marry into?  you guys just keep getting cooler and cooler!   i'm leaving you.  who?   did i go to this school?   sure, nice.  you're right, by saying \"nice\" i'm virtually licking her.  are you asking permission to break the pact?  awesome, the name really stands out.  man, we're gonna rock that asian student union!  you know, our band is playing on friday.  fresh!  mint!  i know it. you know, i'm totally gonna ask her out.  i said it first, bro.  totally. i had sex in high school...  all right, i'd say we make a pact. neither of us will go out with missy goldberg.  oh, and sheena easton. but we probably couldn't get her anyway.  well, i officially give you permission to break the pact.   excuse me. . that didn't make us sound gay at all!  ross, that was 16 years ago!  i believe the foundation of our friendship was unfortunate hair.  all right, look, if we're really gonna do this... it's not like you never broke one of the pacts.  oh really?  oh really!?  adrienne turner!!   oh please, and you knew how much i liked her.  really?  aren't you...?  hi monica.  o-kay. i'll see if i can find ross.   well, i did and it hurt.  that's when i wrote the song: \"betrayal in the common room\".  look  it was a lo-o-ong time ago.   hmm mmmhm..   just one more thing. i was so pissed at you that night that i wanted to get back at you. so i thought, who does ross like the more than anybody?  not her!  soo... you girls having fun?  well maybe if you go to school here next year we can totally hang out.  well, maybe you can get in on a beauty scholarship.  so where are you applying to?   i'm in college and i'm in a band.   yeah, but it was like a million years ago, so it doesn't matter.  why?  you kissed her that night too?  seriously, where did this happen?  oh wait... what bed did you say she was on?  why would i kiss a girl, and then put her on your bed?  what did i marry into?  hey!  you look great. i'm so glad we're having this rehearsal dinner, you know, i so rarely get to practice my meals before i eat them.   no stupid jokes. i thought that was for the actual wedding.   you know what i just realized? we have no idea what we're doing in the wedding tomorrow.  heh.  this is like figure skating team all over again.  i mean synchronized swimming.  i mean- i mean the balance beam.  help me!  i know, i hate being left out of things.  fine. we're just sitting here. alone. doing nothing. it's our rehearsal for tomorrow.  what happened?   m-me-me-me!  pick me, i look great in a tux and i will not steal focus.  oh, i will. but i will need a mirror... as he is me!  you are going downer!  mike didn't tell you? you have to chose one of us to be in your wedding. one of his groomsmen fell out.  just not enough to put us in the original wedding party.  hey, can i talk to you about this groomsman thing? if you pick ross, he'll walk you down the isle just fine. but if you choose me, you'll be getting some comedy!  let me tell you why you need to pick me.  see, when i was a kid, i was always left out of everything, you know, and it really made me feel... insecure. you know, i was always picked last in gym. even behind that big fat exchange student who didn't even know the rules to baseball. i mean, this guy would strike out and then run to third. anyway, if i'm the only one left out of this wedding, i just know that all those feelings are gonna come rushing back.    y-y-yeeesss! make \"groom\" for chandler.  how's it going?    that's what i was doing too.  you too.   me too.  you told us both we could be in the wedding?   rach, rach, knock knock.  i'll tell you at the wedding.  so technically, would this person be in the wedding?  i'm not scared.  i'll just take little chappy and...  he can sense my fear. my throat is exposed.   i'll do it.   na ha ha...  ne he he...  ah ah...   is it okay that i want you to wear that head set in bed tonight?  ready?  okay.  that really was an incredible wedding.  i'd love to, but it's 2300 hours and i'm about to have the most organized sex anyone's ever had.  i don't know. maybe he hooked up with that hot girl he was talking to.  hey.  why are you wearing my apron?  oh, hey, when she gets here, is it ok if i introduce you two as \"my wife\" and \"the woman who's carrying my child\"?  no? divorce?  oh, those places! there's always so many people, their being corralled like cattle, and... you know, there's always some idiot who goes \"mooooo\"!  i'm so sorry...  monica. calm, self.  why would you say that?  great!  this baby'd better to be really good.  that's great.   so, what does the other guy do? does he go to college too?   i'll bet his dad doesn't think so.  of course i'm awake. assume from now on that i'm always awake!   honey, it's us. of course it's the shovel-killer.  i'd keep an eye on him! we have to find out which one the father is.   i dunno, aren't there tests for these things, right?  hey! how was lunch?   oh, really?   o-okay.  so, is she gonna take the test?  oh god. it's shovely-joe, isn't it?   how do you know?   oh god! what was it? the thing that we hardly ever do or the thing we never do?   shovely joe!  yeah, i don't know why we hang out with married couples more often.  you mean that portuguese couple? yeah, like you wouldn't have done it.   a dinosaur died a million years ago?  you never did it!  hey! i will have you know that... aah, who am i kidding. let's call the kid geller and let bing die with me.  hey joe! we've got a couple of things we've got to check out at the new house. you want to come with us?  yeah, come with us. you'll see how close it is to the city.  damn it.  hey, how'd the interview go?  you know, i always feel that way after an interview. i'll bet it went better than you think.  that is a bad interview.  ooh! israeli champagne. and it's vanilla!  to ross!  what?  when your head was hanging out the window, it didn't hit a mailbox, did it?  man, those two dogs are going at it!  hey.  really? what changed your mind?  joey, there was a little girl who lived here, but she died like 30 years ago.  ha! i'm just messing with you.  you don't think we'd buy a house and not have a joey room do you?  it's seven years ago.  my time machine works!  for your information, i was staring at her baby. we're about to be parents.  how did the job stuff go?  that's great!  how did the job stuff go?  or facing a bitch of a commute.  well, it makes me feel sad, but...  is this the best way to use one of your three magic wishes?  we close escrow tomorrow, so seeing another house can only confuse   us, and we're easily confused. we're not very bright.  what do you think pheebs?  yeah.  you're kidding!  oh yeah?   i know. *he* always wanted to be the first black man to cross the   atlantic.  unless snoopy says it to charlie brown, i think we're okay.  it feels like we’re cheating on our house.   and if we’re gonna cheat, shouldn’t it be with like a hot, younger house,   that does stuff that our house won’t do?  sure.  and yet i never run into beyonce!   why!?  this can not be happening!  the only way that that is going to happen, is if the other couple   are the hitlers.  that is a great idea! and by the way, i don't mean to sound distasteful,   but when did you start crapping money!?  will we love it so much with her next door? and she's gonna be louder   out here too. just the crickets and  \"oh my god\"!    well, we   have to do something. we can't have her living next door.  oh, that does it too.   the hitlers will be so disappointed.  i never stopped loving you.  yeah, yeah, yeah! i want you... i need you... i must have you janice   litman goralnik neihosenstein.  now that you live next door, we can be together every day. sid and   monica never have to know a thing.   obviously.  i understand.   they're never coming down now.  hey!  where's your passport?  well, it's not.  we're taking a break!  jumping on the bed?  no, no, no, guys. she's right. we should get to work. i'll take stuff out of the closet, joey you pack 'em and ross you re-pack whatever joey packs.  i didn't know monica had these!  hey.  i know, she's been such a big part of my life. and it feels like when melrose place got cancelled.  i mean... oh, forget it. i miss melrose place!  yes, joe?  oh, yes. i decided to leave these out for you in case richard stops by and you wanna  engage on a little light bondage and moustache play!   . well played.  uh, rach?   uh, rach... i think i have something that belongs to you.   no, no, no... they're really yours. we... found them in your old room.  pheebs!  i think these are yours.  sure.  you don't really handcuff guys to waterpipes do you?  let me just say something... because once we get into this, i'm gonna get all uncomfortable and probably make some stupid joke... i just want to say that i... i love you... and, i'm gonna miss you. and i'm so sad that you're leaving.  ooh, not so tight...  i'm sorry, just give me one more chance.  i'm sor... just go. just go. i can't, i can't.   that old woman was being scammed by her mechanic.   mine was a humdinger    joey and i can finish up in the guest room.   you couldn't be cool.   hey mon, i think i figured out whose handcuffs they are.  well, i was cleaning out the closet and i found some pictures of them... being used.  monica's grandmother.  relax! we just get her some antacids.  oh my god!  honey, it's gonna be okay.  relax! we'll just get her some antacids.  next time, can i say breathe?  where are you going?  you can't leave me alone with her.  this is exactly the kind of social situation that i am not   comfortable with!  it's just that we've never spent any time, you know, alone   together.  okay.  well, it's just interesting. you know, because no one will   ever know, because no one can experience both.  one of life's great, unanswerable questions. i mean, who   knows? maybe there's something even more painful than those things? like this.  is it really that bad?  i'm okay.  alright. wow, that is one disgusting miracle.  wow!   it's a baby! a beautiful little baby! and some  other stuff i'm gonna pretend i don't see.  well, that's spongy.  i know. he has your eyes.  i mean, i know that's not possible, but he does.  okay.  oh, yeah! these are the faces of two people in the know!  interesting!  can i see you for a second?  what do we do?  uh-huh! join me, won't you?! okay, what do you say we keep  one, and then just like have an option on the other one?  what if they're not? what if it's adopted by a king?  monica, we are not ready to have two babies!  okay.  okay!   she? it's a girl?  bye!  have fun at church-camp!  i know! you ready to trade?  okay.  we could trade later.  hey.  her name is erica.  yeah. it's a shame you two didn't get to spend more time  together.  i have no idea what's going on, but i am excited!  we were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but  now we understand you were doing this.  oh, don't worry, we'll find them.  alright.  it's okay, it's just an egg roll.  okay, let's find these birds.  well, that can't be good!  how?  oh, tons, i'm quite the woodsman.  joey, wait! the ball!  i don't know. maybe we can open this up somehow.  no... it's all glued together.  did that movie ever get made?  and we're also gonna buy you tiny, bird hearing-aids.  what's the matter?  i understand.  i don't know. except that, for one last time...  good game, good game, good game,   good game, good game, good game, good game.  well, i can't do it either.  we have to bust it open, but neither of us can do it!  that was... impressive.  sorry about the table, man.  you gonna buy a new one?  well, at least we got these little guys out.  aww, we were worried about you! hm. i guess i better get   used to things crapping in my hand, huh?  hey, you know what? maybe we should keep them here with you.  yeah, i mean we've got a lot going on right now. and, plus,   here they'd have their own room.  i think there may be another reason. so, awkward hug or lame   cool guy handshake?  wow, this is weird.  where's ross?   look around, you guys. this was your first   home. and it was a happy place, filled with love and laughter. but   more important, because of rent control, it was a friggin' steal!  oh, it's gonna be okay.\n"
